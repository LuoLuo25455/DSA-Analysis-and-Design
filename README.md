## What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The biggest issue I have encountered when I first entered this course was a conversion from Java to C++. I was very used to Java programming but C++ was relatively new to me

## How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
The good thing was that Java and C++ share very similar data structures so the data conversion was easy. I also spent fair amount of time reviewing videos on C++ to enhance my knowledge

## How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
There were two approaches I took. The first was to go back to the module reading and discover any information that might help from the root pages. The second was to review other open-source turorial videos online that can not only teach me on what the current module was focusing on but also anything else that I might have missed.

## How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
The design of this course is very reasonable and helpful on building up my knowledge in data structures. The first project provided me a first glance of thought to consider how to establish a functioning program but using pseudocode. The second project applied what I have understood from project one and turned everything into C++ code. 

## How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Data structure is one of the most important topics in almost all computer languages, and C++ provides a relatively easy-to-understand environment for me to understand why certain code has to be written in certain way. I fortunately have also applied my knowledge learned from other sources to check the potential vulnerabilities in my code and added enhanced features to make sure the data structures are maintainable and expandible.
